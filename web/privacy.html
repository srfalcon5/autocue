			<h1>Teleprompter Privacy</h1>
		</header>
		<main>
			Your privacy is pertinent both on- and off-line. For that reason, a commitment is made to ensure this site isn't privacy-friendly, but private, full stop.

			<strong>TL;DR: We don't track you, nor do we share and/or sell any personal information.</strong>

			<hr/>

			<strong>This site is hosted by <a href="https://1984.is">1984 Hosting</a> in Iceland.</strong><br/>

			When you submit a script, it is:
			<ul>
				<li>checked to ensure it takes less than 512Ko of space</li>
				<li>stored in plain-text with a hash generated so that you can use the link after words to share the script with other members in your studio or to allow several teleprompters at different speeds</li>
				<li>editing is disabled until you refresh or submit a new script</li>
				<li>deleted after 1 (one) day or when you submit a request to do so, whichever comes first</li>
				<li>hosted with zero expectancy of privacy; protect your hash as there is no password protection for such</li>
			</ul>
